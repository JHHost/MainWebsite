                Cat Carnival is a micro game collection developed during my first year at SAE University as apart of my degree. I was in charge of programming, source control, debugging and overseeing development. I also took part in developing some of the micro games, specifically the Fishing and Balloon Darts games. Once the project was completed on the University side I took to completing it and porting it to mobile on my own in my own time.
