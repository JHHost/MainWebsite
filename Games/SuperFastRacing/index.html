                Super Fast Racing is an ironic name for an ironic game. It was developed in a few hours during a Game Jam with the theme of Time/Durations. The game ended up as a small demo as I had been held up in time wise from external factors. This was one of my first full explorations into Unreal Engine and taught me a lot about using my existing skills in different engines.<br>The assets were copyright free which I found online but all the code and logic were built from scratch.
