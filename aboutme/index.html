            <h2>Hi, I'm Jayden Holliss.</h2>
            <p>I'm an English programmer and game developer based in Australia that loves helping bring game visions to life. </p>
            <p>I have an Associates Degree in Game Development, specilising in Games Programming, from SAE University. 
                <br>I am currently working on getting my Bachelor's Degree in Game Development, specilising in Games Programming at SAE University.</p>
            <p>
                <br>I've been a programmer since 2020 and I've been doing video games since 2022. In this time I have developed custom tools, website front and back ends, and a variety of games.
                <br>The large majority of my work is custom but I can also work with existing frameworks when required.
                <br>All my publicly published games can be found on the <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio tab of this website</a>. Most of these games were developed in tandem with teams formed for the projects. In these teams I took combinations of leadership, design and programming roles.
